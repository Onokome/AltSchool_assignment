          From an early age, I have been deeply fascinated by technology and its
          transformative impact on society. Growing up in an era where
          technology increasingly shapes our daily lives, I have always been
          eager to understand how these innovations come to fruition and
          contribute to solving real-world problems. This curiosity led me to
          pursue a diploma from Federal Polytechnic Auchi, where I excelled in
          my studies.
